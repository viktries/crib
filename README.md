# Crib
A Simple MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) app allowing users to train Machine Learning Models on CSV files they upload. The users can then use these models on other csv files to make predictions. 

We spawn child processes to Python and use callbacks to route throughout the app.

TODO:
react-material-ui
visualize algorithms and accuracies
add more options for ml algorithms to choose from
set params for algorithms (easy but tedious)
