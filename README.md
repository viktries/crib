# Crib
A MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) app allowing users to train Machine Learning Models on CSV files they upload. The users can then use these models on other csv files to make predictions. 

Uses Sklearn for Label Encoding, Hot-One Encoding, and ML Models. We spawn child processes to Python and use callbacks to route throughout the app.

Requires: SKLearn and Numpy

TODO:
visualize algorithms and accuracies
add more options for ml algorithms to choose from
set params for algorithms (easy but tedious)
